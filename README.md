Adapted LandBOSSE replacing regular grid layout with irregular layout. Turbines and substation coordinates are inputs to the LandBOSSE code.

# LandBOSSE for irregular layouts

## Welcome to LandBOSSE!

The Land-based Balance-of-System Systems Engineering (LandBOSSE) model is a systems engineering tool that estimates the balance-of-system (BOS) costs associated with installing utility scale wind plants (10, 1.5 MW turbines or larger). It can execute on macOS and Windows. At this time, for both platforms, it is a command line tool that needs to be accessed from the command line.

The methods used to develop this model (specifically, LandBOSSE Version 2.1.0) are described in greater detail the following report:

## User Guides

First, read the technical report to understand the big picture of LandBOSSE. In the technical report, you will find process diagrams, equations and the modules that implement them. Then, come back to this documentation and read the user guide.

In brief, LandBOSSE takes `.xlsx` spreadsheets, reads input data from tabs on the spreadsheets, and writes the results to an output `.xlsx` file. There are three sections in the user guide to demonstrate how to perform these steps.

The user guide comes in three parts:

1. Software installation,

2. Input data configuration, and

3. Output data analysis.

### Software Installation

Changed from original LandBOSSE model!
Updated instructions:
1. Install anaconda
2. Clone source code or download to desired path
3. Open terminal, navigate to folder
4. Type "pip install -e ."
5. Run LandBOSSE by executing the file "run_landbosse.py".

### Operation after the installation

Review the installation instructions on how to activate a virtual environment, if you haven't already.

Then, read the [Operation and Folder Structure](installation_instructions/operation_and_folder_structure.md) for details on running the command that executes LandBOSSE from the command line.
